00:00:03.482 --> 00:00:04.748
Hey, velhos tempos.

2
00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.316
Esqueceu alguma coisa?

3
00:00:06.318 --> 00:00:11.822
Ohh, you forgot the staples.

4
00:00:11.824 --> 00:00:14.791
Oh, we truly are the main
office pranksters, aren't we?

5
00:00:14.793 --> 00:00:17.861
This turned out amazing.

6
00:00:17.863 --> 00:00:20.096
You're a genius, Bill.

7
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.201
Why isn't this cutting?

8
00:00:24.203 --> 00:00:26.169
Oh, no.

9
00:00:26.171 --> 00:00:27.637
Uh, what's the matter, Bill?

10
00:00:27.639 --> 00:00:30.474
Did someone dull the paper cutter?

11
00:00:30.476 --> 00:00:32.943
[together] Ahh!

12
00:00:36.815 --> 00:00:37.981
What the hell is this?

13
00:00:37.983 --> 00:00:39.649
Uh, what do you mean?

14
00:00:39.651 --> 00:00:41.184
It's a coffee pot. Is
that not coffee in there?

15
00:00:41.186 --> 00:00:42.986
Oh, is there not coffee?

16
00:00:42.988 --> 00:00:45.388
Actually, Ders, don't you mean flat Dr.
Pepper pot?

17
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.327
Because we put flat Dr. Pepper
in a coffee pot and switched it.

18
00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:51.495
We pwn'd you!

19
00:00:51.497 --> 00:00:55.966
[laughter]

20
00:00:55.968 --> 00:00:57.300
Y'all ain't funny.

21
00:00:57.302 --> 00:00:59.069
Oh, my God.

22
00:00:59.071 --> 00:01:00.670
Oh, my God. I can't breathe.

23
00:01:00.672 --> 00:01:02.305
I can't breathe. It's too funny.

24
00:01:02.307 --> 00:01:04.040
Oh, it's too good of a prank.
I can't breathe.

No, Adam. It's not even a contest.

31
00:01:18.857 --> 00:01:20.490
The monkey would bite
the Rock's dick off.

32
00:01:20.492 --> 00:01:23.260
What if he wore a muzzle?

33
00:01:23.262 --> 00:01:24.928
Wait, on his dick?

34
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.663
No, on his face.

35
00:01:26.665 --> 00:01:28.431
Muzzle... although that's a
good idea, muzzle on your dick.

36
00:01:28.433 --> 00:01:30.100
I want to wear one on mine.

37
00:01:30.102 --> 00:01:31.401
Okay, wait, you've completely
changed the question

38
00:01:31.403 --> 00:01:33.103
at this point.

39
00:01:33.105 --> 00:01:34.070
Yeah, that's not what
we're talking about.

40
00:01:34.072 --> 00:01:35.639
What is this?

41
00:01:35.641 --> 00:01:39.075
Okay, now I'm looking at
the top of page three:

42
00:01:39.077 --> 00:01:42.178
"Unapproved attire
includes halter tops,

43
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.448
shirts with spaghetti
straps, biker shorts...

44
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.183
No wonder this office sucks.

45
00:01:47.185 --> 00:01:49.686
I mean, we've got Bill
hiring all these old fogies.

46
00:01:49.688 --> 00:01:52.923
Mm-hmm, I mean, this place could
be like... like Coachella.

47
00:01:52.925 --> 00:01:54.357
- Oh, that would be sick.
- Right?

48
00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:56.092
Like, sexy young thangs wearing, like,

49
00:01:56.094 --> 00:01:57.594
kind of racist Indian headdresses

50
00:01:57.596 --> 00:01:59.229
- Really racist.
- You know?

51
00:01:59.231 --> 00:02:01.064
Yes, they're racist, but they look hot.

52
00:02:01.066 --> 00:02:03.366
Is it racist if it's hot?
That's the question.

53
00:02:03.368 --> 00:02:06.436
What if we had some hip
youngsters in here, you know?

54
00:02:06.438 --> 00:02:08.772
We could, like, talk about
viral videos or, like,

55
00:02:08.774 --> 00:02:12.309
fashion trends or, like, totally
be kept up with the Kardashians,

56
00:02:12.311 --> 00:02:14.744
which I've been wanting
to get kept up on.

57
00:02:14.746 --> 00:02:18.081
All I'm saying is, we should be
the ones running the train...

58
00:02:18.083 --> 00:02:20.417
trainee... trainee's...

59
00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:22.552
oh, I've never seen that word before.

60
00:02:22.554 --> 00:02:23.720
That is a weird word.

61
00:02:23.722 --> 00:02:26.957
New Employees Bagel Bash.

62
00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.391
Here's me at mine.

63
00:02:28.393 --> 00:02:32.262
Okay, thank you, Bill.

64
00:02:32.264 --> 00:02:34.898
We will take it from here, all right?

65
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.401
Hey, my name is Adam,
the top sales dog,

66
00:02:38.403 --> 00:02:40.837
or at least pretty
high up there, DeMamp,

67
00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:42.606
and these are my associates.

68
00:02:42.608 --> 00:02:44.674
Howdy, I'm Blake, and you
are probably thinking,

69
00:02:44.676 --> 00:02:46.977
"What is going on here?"

70
00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:48.845
Well, this ain't your

71
00:02:48.847 --> 00:02:50.480
granddaddy's orientation anymore.

72
00:02:50.482 --> 00:02:52.248
- No, it's not.
- What are you doing?

73
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.817
Alice said I could do this.

74
00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.752
Alice said that you were
really bad at your job, Bill,

75
00:02:55.754 --> 00:02:57.520
and that you're suspended for a
week and you should go home now

76
00:02:57.522 --> 00:02:58.822
and not even talk to her about it.

77
00:02:58.824 --> 00:03:00.457
I can't go home now.

78
00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.326
My roommate gives tap-dancing
lessons to seven-year-old

79
00:03:03.328 --> 00:03:05.295
fart boxes all day.

80
00:03:05.297 --> 00:03:06.830
This sucks! Ahh!

81
00:03:06.832 --> 00:03:08.164
Okay, you're embarrassing
yourself, Bill.

82
00:03:08.166 --> 00:03:09.633
- Oh, okay, all right.
- That was loud.

83
00:03:09.635 --> 00:03:10.934
- Jeez.
- I didn't feel safe, you know?

84
00:03:10.936 --> 00:03:12.535
- It was scary.
- Yeah, yeah.

85
00:03:12.537 --> 00:03:14.638
He should go give screaming
lessons to seven-year-olds.

86
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.306
I didn't... I didn't like that.
I didn't like that either.

87
00:03:16.308 --> 00:03:17.707
And now it's just us, guys.
Let's get comfortable.

88
00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.175
Why don't we pull out the index ca

89
00:03:19.177 --> 00:03:21.478
in your pamphlet there, okay?

90
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.181
Take a pen or a thick marker and
write your age on that card

91
00:03:25.183 --> 00:03:27.117
and hold it up nice and
high so we can see.

92
00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:28.451
Great call. Uh-oh.

93
00:03:28.453 --> 00:03:30.453
Wow, that once says four. Yikes.

94
00:03:30.455 --> 00:03:32.022
Four, four, a couple fours.

95
00:03:32.024 --> 00:03:34.290
Oh, I like these three
right there with the twos.

96
00:03:34.292 --> 00:03:36.292
Yes, and yes.

97
00:03:36.294 --> 00:03:38.161
Absolutely not. Sit your ass down.

98
00:03:38.163 --> 00:03:40.830
Because you have a three as your
first letter in your number.

99
00:03:40.832 --> 00:03:42.532
- Ew, 35?
- Mm-mm.

100
00:03:42.534 --> 00:03:44.167
Yeah, that's really bad.

101
00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:46.336
Okay, so if my friend
Adam here pointed to you,

102
00:03:46.338 --> 00:03:48.672
why don't you come on up, tell
us a little bit about yourself,

103
00:03:48.674 --> 00:03:51.808
what makes you tick.

104
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.044
Yo, what's up? Salute. Dab.

105
00:03:54.046 --> 00:03:57.847
[all babbling indistinctly]

106
00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.582
What's up, guys? My name's Colt.

107
00:03:59.584 --> 00:04:02.018
22, young, fit, black,
kind of into bacon lately.

108
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.420
It's my thing.

109
00:04:03.422 --> 00:04:05.088
- All right.
- All right, like that.

110
00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.657
Suh. I'm Leila, wish I was black,

111
00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:11.327
and all bacon e'rythang.

112
00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:13.263
[laughter] Sure.

113
00:04:13.265 --> 00:04:15.031
I'm Mykyl with two Ys.

114
00:04:15.033 --> 00:04:18.368
I'm white, but sensitively,
I am racially colorblind.

115
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.936
That's tight.

116
00:04:19.938 --> 00:04:23.606
I... I'm a vegan, except
for bacon, of course.

117
00:04:23.608 --> 00:04:27.544
Well, now that they said their
part, now is your part.

118
00:04:27.546 --> 00:04:28.912
Please get up and leave. You're fired.
I'm sorry.

119
00:04:28.914 --> 00:04:30.346
- You are fired.
- Yeah, we're good.

120
00:04:30.348 --> 00:04:31.548
Bye-bye. Bye. Sorry about that.

121
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:32.549
- This way.
- Yep.

122
00:04:32.551 --> 00:04:34.584
This is blatant ageism.

123
00:04:34.586 --> 00:04:37.353
You might be too old to
understand what we were saying.

124
00:04:37.355 --> 00:04:39.923
I'm saying you're fired,
'cause you're too old, okay?

125
00:04:39.925 --> 00:04:41.524
- Buh-bye.
- [bleep] you.

126
00:04:41.526 --> 00:04:43.259
- [together] Oh.
- How's that for old?

127
00:04:43.261 --> 00:04:44.761
- Oh, okay.
- Oh, okay.

128
00:04:44.763 --> 00:04:45.895
I liked her suit, though.

129
00:04:45.897 --> 00:04:47.397
- What a second.
- Ohh.

130
00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:48.465
Wow.

131
00:04:48.467 --> 00:04:49.933
Guys, guys, guys.

132
00:04:49.935 --> 00:04:54.404
What does your card say there?

133
00:04:54.406 --> 00:04:55.572
69.

134
00:04:55.574 --> 00:04:56.973
Is that your actual age?

135
00:04:56.975 --> 00:04:58.441
Yes.

136
00:04:58.443 --> 00:05:00.110
Are you kidding me? I've never met one.

137
00:05:00.112 --> 00:05:01.444
- I've never met one.
- Yeah, it's crazy.

138
00:05:01.446 --> 00:05:04.447
So, like, do you what,
like, 69, like means?

139
00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:05.849
The sexual term?

140
00:05:05.851 --> 00:05:08.551
Oh, dude, this dude's a freak.

141
00:05:08.553 --> 00:05:12.155
- You nasty.
- It is sexual.

142
00:05:12.157 --> 00:05:13.490
That's a hilarious age.

143
00:05:13.492 --> 00:05:16.059
Okay, I think, yeah,
you can stick around,

144
00:05:16.061 --> 00:05:17.927
and from now on, you're name is 69 Man.

145
00:05:17.929 --> 00:05:19.829
You're 69 Man, dude.
That's your nickname.

146
00:05:19.831 --> 00:05:21.231
My name is Jerry.

147
00:05:21.233 --> 00:05:23.433
Hey, Blake, it's Anders.

148
00:05:23.435 --> 00:05:25.735
Hey, are you over there on your
phone pretending like you're on

149
00:05:25.737 --> 00:05:26.970
a super-important call?

150
00:05:26.972 --> 00:05:29.139
Yes, I am, actually.

151
00:05:29.141 --> 00:05:31.407
I look like I'm working very hard,

152
00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:34.077
but really I'm just talking to
my friends and horsing around.

153
00:05:34.079 --> 00:05:36.579
Hey, Blake and Anders, it's Adam,

154
00:05:36.581 --> 00:05:40.683
and I'm doing what you guys just
explained that we're doing.

155
00:05:40.685 --> 00:05:41.918
- Right.
- So shut up, Mom.

156
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.319
I'm talking to my friends, okay?

157
00:05:43.321 --> 00:05:44.821
Oh, so you are talking to somebody.

158
00:05:44.823 --> 00:05:46.489
- Shut up. Shut up.
- No, you shut up.

159
00:05:46.491 --> 00:05:49.192
You're... you're a
disrespectful bitch, okay?

160
00:05:49.194 --> 00:05:50.827
You also get long-distance calls.

161
00:05:50.829 --> 00:05:52.295
Sick life hack.

162
00:05:52.297 --> 00:05:54.197
- Yeah.
- Hacksaw Jim Duggan.

163
00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:56.866
- Yeah.
- I think we done with work.

164
00:05:56.868 --> 00:06:00.770
And right now, I think it's time
to do what we came here to do,

165
00:06:00.772 --> 00:06:02.138
and that is... uh-oh, I got an itch.

166
00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.173
Oh.

167
00:06:03.175 --> 00:06:07.010
And that itch is to prank.

168
00:06:07.012 --> 00:06:08.778
No, I want the one with the hot tub.

169
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.280
It's the honeymoon suite, okay?

170
00:06:10.282 --> 00:06:11.548
- And I'm gonna fill that tub up...
- Yo, Tez.

171
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:12.649
Your car is getting towed.

172
00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:14.117
Oh, my God. Not again.

173
00:06:14.119 --> 00:06:15.618

You don't get it?

178
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.327
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah.

179
00:06:24.329 --> 00:06:27.630
Dude, your car is horn-y...

182
00:06:30.936 --> 00:06:32.802
I ain't got no time for this bullshit.

183

It's too hot out here.
It's too hot for this.

- What?
- Oh, he just got pranked.

185
00:06:36.908 --> 00:06:39.475
That is just an example of, you know,

186
00:06:39.477 --> 00:06:41.477
some of the pranks we pull on
a regular basis around here.

187
00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:43.313
Just one of the many, really.

188
00:06:43.315 --> 00:06:45.648
But sometimes we've got to get
real, just like you guys,

189
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.650
and set some boundaries, some rules.

190
00:06:47.652 --> 00:06:50.353
Number one rule, no snitching,
not to Alice, nobody.

191
00:06:50.355 --> 00:06:54.257
And that's true, 'cause snitches get...

192
00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:56.693
- [together] Stitches.
- Put in a body bag, right?

193
00:06:56.695 --> 00:06:58.561
'Cause we will frickin'
murder a snitch.

194
00:06:58.563 --> 00:07:00.563
- Yeah, yeah, stop...
- So no snitches.

195
00:07:00.565 --> 00:07:02.565
'Cause snitches are...

196
00:07:02.567 --> 00:07:04.167

Oh, and one more for
Michael with two Ys,

200
00:07:09.608 --> 00:07:11.074
because he's inquisitive.

201
00:07:11.076 --> 00:07:14.677
But seriously, guys, nothing
like a hot-roof beer

202
00:07:14.679 --> 00:07:16.512
after pulling a cold-blooded prank.

203
00:07:16.514 --> 00:07:17.747
[laughter] It was cold-blooded.

204
00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:21.084
It is the absolute best.

205
00:07:21.086 --> 00:07:23.052
Oh, Jesus, dude. That is super hot.

206
00:07:23.054 --> 00:07:24.687
It's like soup.

207
00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:25.889
Yeah, well, they've been on
the roof for a week, so...

208
00:07:25.891 --> 00:07:27.590
- Yeah.
- It's still good.

209
00:07:27.592 --> 00:07:28.958
Guys, I'd like to propose a
toast, if you don't mind.

210
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.261
- Sure.
- To the three best mentors

211
00:07:31.263 --> 00:07:32.262

idea for a pretty cool thing

to use the office for, but...
ah, you know what?

not just see what he did?

Good, man, I've been shooting
porno since junior high, bro.

300
00:10:36.983 --> 00:10:39.050
It's, like... it's, like,
my main side hustle.

301

Oh, my God. I'm hyperventilating.

would be my dream gig.

don't have side hustles?

304
00:10:44.891 --> 00:10:46.857
Uh-uh, no. This is our main hustle.

305
00:10:46.859 --> 00:10:48.726
And then we just go smoke weed
and drink beers on the roof.

- Which... it's a hustle.
- Yeah.

hungry, if you know what I mean.

chow-ders, all right?

need stamina, all right?

ate in Beijing, okay?

332
00:11:39.879 --> 00:11:41.345

what happened in Beijing.

333
00:11:43.049 --> 00:11:44.448

and they want to know

343
