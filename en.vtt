King Ecbert handed him
over to King Aelle.

Our father is probably dead by now.

You think he knows about Father?

48
00:02:59.505 --> 00:03:04.209
Oh, so, you think that Odin told
us, but forgot to tell Bjorn? Hmm?

49
00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.578
Hopefully he will be home soon.

50

how the old boar suffered.

55
00:03:22.862 --> 00:03:26.364
So now we're grunting. So what?

56
00:03:26.466 --> 00:03:29.101

- Not only

59
00:03:32.605 --> 00:03:35.574
I told you,

60
00:03:35.675 --> 00:03:38.677
King Ecbert offered our
father up like a sacrifice,

61
00:03:38.778 --> 00:03:40.812
so we'll do the same thing to him.

62
00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:45.050
That is what Father wanted.

63
00:03:46.385 --> 00:03:49.087
That is the message that he
wanted me to bring to you.

64
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.991
That is so easy to say, Ivar.

Ecbert's kingdom is vast.

How do we overcome that

71
00:04:13.846 --> 00:04:16.781
when we have never attempted
anything like that before?

72

We raise a great army.

75
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.191

76
